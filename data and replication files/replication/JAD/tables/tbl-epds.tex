  \item Note. In addition to including the original 10 EPDS items, we also included revised EPDS items that matched the format and response options of the PHQ-9. First, we rephrased the new set of EPDS items so that women could indicate how often they have been bothered by the particular problem in the past two weeks, rather than the past one week. Second, we reworded the three `positive' EPDS items to express problems.

  \item Note. We removed items included in the ``Core'' and ``Standard'' versions of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) and the Bromley Postnatal Depression Scale (BPDS) because the scales assess a patient's history rather than her depressive symptoms. For instance, the BPDS includes items such as ``Did you talk to a psychiatrist because you felt depressed during the first year after the baby was born?'' An example PRAMS ``Core'' item is ``Thinking back just before you got pregnant with your new baby, how did you feel about becoming pregnant?''.

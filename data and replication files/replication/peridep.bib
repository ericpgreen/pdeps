	Abstract = {Background
Perinatal mental health disorders are recognised as an important public health issue in low-income countries as well as in developed countries. This paper reviews evidence on the prevalence and risk factors of maternal mental health disorders in African women living in Africa.
Methods
A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Studies were mainly located through computerised databases, and additionally through hand searching references of identified articles and reviews. Thirty-five studies, with a total of 10,880 participants, were identified that reported prevalence rates of maternal psychological health in eight African countries.
Results
Depression was the most commonly assessed disorder with a weighted mean prevalence of 11.3\% (95\% CI 9.5\%--13.1\%) during pregnancy and 18.3\% (95\% CI 17.6\%--19.1\%) after birth. Only a small number of studies assessed other psychological disorders. Prevalence rates of pre- and postnatal anxiety were 14.8\% (95\% CI 12.3\%--17.4\%) and 14.0\% (95\% CI 12.9\%--15.2\%), respectively; and one study reported the prevalence of PTSD as 5.9\% (95\% CI 4.4\%--7.4\%) following childbirth. Lack of support and marital/family conflict were associated with poorer mental health. Evidence relating sociodemographic and obstetric variables to mental health was inconclusive.
Limitations
Most studies included in this review were cross-sectional and measures of mental health varied considerably.
Conclusions
This paper demonstrates that maternal mental health disorders are prevalent in African women, and highlights the importance of maternal mental health care being integrated into future maternal and infant health policies in African countries.},

@article{Patel:1997,
	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop an indigenous measure of common mental disorders (CMD) in the Shona language in Zimbabwe. Ethnographic and qualitative studies elicited idioms of distress of mental disorder leading to the preliminary Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ), and items from the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ) were added to it. The 56-item Preliminary Shona Symptom Questionnaire (PSSQ) was administered to 302 randomly selected primary care attenders, of whom 100 were classified as cases on the basis of agreement between care provider assessment and a psychiatric interview. Discriminant analysis identified 14 items that were the strongest predictors of mental disorder. The 14-item SSQ has a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85). The items are a mixture of emic and etic phenomena. The total score correlates strongly with patients' self-assessment of the emotional nature of their illness. Satisfactory specificity and sensitivity occurred at a cut-off point of 7/8. The SSQ is the first indigenous measure of mental disorder developed in sub-Saharan Africa to have included idioms or distress of primary care attenders and involved patients consulting traditional medical practitioners. It promises to be a useful instrument for epidemiological and clinical research. The methodology used is an innovative way of combining etic and emic methods in the evaluation of CMD.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on experience with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) in a Tanzanian population, this study attempted to develop a locally specific screen that employs indigenous expressions.
AIM AND METHOD: Thirty ethnographically derived local idioms were added and the final 47-item questionnaire administered to 787 randomly selected antenatal clinic attendees.
RESULTS: Logistic regression identified 19 items for the Dar-es-Salaam Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ), which demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84), interrater reliability (intraclass r = 0.89), and test-retest reliability (intraclass r = 0.82). Positive endorsement overall increased only slightly, but the report of mild symptoms was more frequent with the DSQ (15.0\%) than the HSCL-25 (10.8\%). Content and discriminant validation of the local scale conformed to expectation, but depressed affect failed to emerge as an important feature.
CONCLUSION: Locally derived expressions may aid in the reporting of illness and illness severity. Further studies are recommended to uncover universal aspects and culturally specific manifestations of illness expression.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postnatal mental disorders are common causes of morbidity but are rarely diagnosed or treated in busy primary care clinics in developing countries.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a brief psychiatric screening questionnaire used in the 8th month of pregnancy can predict postnatal mental disorder.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SITE: A peri-urban settlement in Zimbabwe.
POPULATION: 500 women in the 8th month of pregnancy identified by traditional birth attendants and primary care clinics.
SAMPLE: "High risk" cohort consisted of all women who scored 8 or more on the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ), an indigenous psychiatric questionnaire (n = 95). Low risk cohort consisted of 105 women randomly selected from the remainder of the sampling frame.
OUTCOME MEASURE: Revised Clinical Interview Schedule at six to eight weeks postpartum; scores of 14 or more indicate psychiatric caseness.
RESULTS: The prevalence of postnatal mental illness was 16\%. Odds ratios (95\% confidence intervals) for high risk women becoming cases in the postnatal period were 10.6, 4.8, 23.9, p \ensuremath{<} 0.0001 after adjustment for age, marital status, and occupation.
CONCLUSIONS: A brief method of detecting women at high risk of developing a postnatal mental disorder can be used with reasonable accuracy in the 8th month of pregnancy. Further research is needed to determine whether interventions applied to this high risk group can reduce their postnatal morbidity.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and associated factors for postnatal depression in primary health care (PHC) centers of a developing society.
METHOD: A two-stage screening procedure involving the 10-item self-report Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Present State Examination Schedule was employed.
RESULTS: The prevalence of postnatal depression in the primary care populations studied was 18.6\%. Postnatal depression was found on logistic regression to be independently predicted by younger age (OR, 5.42; 95\% CI, 2.61-10.32; P\ensuremath{<}.05), by being primigravida (OR, 2.73; 95\% CI, 1.44-4.24; P\ensuremath{<}.05), by not having the desired gender for their babies (OR, 2.86; 95\% CI, 1.62-5.93; P\ensuremath{<}.05) and by in-law relationship problems (OR, 3.64; 95\% CI, 1.84-7.22; P\ensuremath{<}.05). The EPDS was shown to be a feasible screening instrument for postnatal depression in the PHC centers (sensitivity, 88.1\%; specificity, 84.3\%; minimum misclassification rate, 15.0\%).
CONCLUSION: The EPDS should be incorporated into the maternal and child health care programs of PHC centers in developing countries in order to ensure early detection and appropriate therapeutic intervention in cases of postnatal depression.},

	Abstract = {Objective The objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of depression in postpartum women and that of non-postpartum women. Method A total of 876 women recruited at 6 weeks postpartum and 900 matched non-postpartum women were administered the Beck's Depressive Inventory (BDI) and translated local version of the EPDS. Psychiatric diagnosis was made using the using the modified non-patient version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-NP). Results Depressive disorder was diagnosed in 128 (14.6\%) of the postpartum women and in 55 (6.3\%) of the non-postpartum women, and the difference was found to be significant (t=8.919, df=875, P\ensuremath{<}0.001). The postpartum women had higher EPDS and BDI scores than the non-postpartum women. The EPDS correlated well with the SCID-NP diagnosis with a Spearman's correlation of 0.600 (P\ensuremath{<}0.001) and with the BDI score with a Spearman's correlation of 0.461 (P\ensuremath{<}0.001). The sensitivity of the EPDS at cut-off score of 8/9 was 94\% and specificity was 97\%. Conclusion The prevalence of postnatal depression in Nigeria is comparable to that of the western world and the Yoruba version of EPDS is a valid instrument for screening postnatal women for depressive disorders in a Nigerian community.},

	Abstract = {Despite the significant burden of common mental disorders (CMD) among women in sub Saharan Africa, data on postnatal depression (PND) is very limited, especially in settings with a high HIV prevalence. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a widely used screening test for PND has been validated in many countries, but not in Zimbabwe. We assessed the validity of the EPDS scale among postpartum women compared with Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for major depression. Six trained community counselors administered the Shona version of the EPDS to a random sample of 210 postpartum HIV-infected and uninfected women attending two primary care clinics in Chitungwiza. All women were subsequently subjected to mental status examination using DSM IV criteria for major depression by 2 psychiatrists, who were blinded to the subject's EPDS scores. Data were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Of the 210 postpartum mothers enrolled, 64 (33\%) met DSM IV criteria for depression. Using a cut-off score of 11/12 on the Shona version of the EPDS for depression, the sensitivity was 88\%, and specificity was 87\%, with a positive predictive value of 74\%, a negative predictive value of 94\%, and an area under the curve of 0.82. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the whole scale was 0.87.
CONCLUSION: The Shona version of the EPDS is a reliable and valid tool to screen for PND among HIV-infected and un-infected women in Zimbabwe. Screening for PND should be integrated into routine antenatal and postnatal care in areas with high HIV prevalence.},

@article{Hanlon:2008,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cultural validity of instruments to detect perinatal common mental disorders (CMD) in rural, community settings has been little-investigated in developing countries.
METHODS: Semantic, content, technical, criterion and construct validity of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) were evaluated in perinatal women in rural Ethiopia. Gold-standard measure of CMD was psychiatric assessment using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS). Community-based, convenience sampling was used. An initial validation study (n=101) evaluated both EPDS and SRQ. Subsequent validation was of SRQ alone (n=119).
RESULTS: EPDS exhibited poor validity; area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.62 (95\%CI 0.49 to 0.76). SRQ-20 showed better validity as a dimensional scale, with AUROC of 0.82 (95\%CI 0.68 to 0.96) and 0.70 (95\%CI 0.57 to 0.83) in the two studies. The utility of SRQ in detecting 'cases' of CMD was not established, with differing estimates of optimal cut-off score: three and above in Study 1 (sensitivity 85.7\%, specificity 75.6\%); seven and above in Study 2 (sensitivity 68.4\%, specificity 62\%). High convergent validity of SRQ as a dimensional measure was demonstrated in a community survey of 1065 pregnant women.
LIMITATIONS: Estimation of optimal cut-off scores and validity coefficients for detecting CMD was limited by sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: EPDS demonstrated limited clinical utility as a screen for perinatal CMD in this rural, low-income setting. The SRQ-20 was superior to EPDS across all domains for evaluating cultural equivalence and showed validity as a dimensional measure of perinatal CMD.},

	Abstract = {Postnatal depression occurs in 10-15\% of women. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item self-report scale designed specifically as a screening instrument for the postnatal period. It was initially validated for use in the UK, but has subsequently been validated for other communities. It has not been validated for an African community.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the EPDS is a valid screening scale for depression in a Johannesburg community cohort.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 103 women attending the postnatal clinic at Coronation Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa.
METHOD: The EPDS was validated against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) criteria for depression. It was administered verbally to participants and translated into one of six South African languages where necessary.
RESULTS: A threshold of 11/12 on the EPDS identified 100\% of women with major depression and 70.6\% of women with minor depression. For major and minor depression combined, sensitivity was 80\%, specificity 76.6\%, positive predictive value 52.6\% and negative predictive value 92.2\%.
CONCLUSION: The EPDS, administered verbally, is a valid screening instrument in this urban South African community.},

@article{Tesfaye:2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) has been used successfully across diverse cultural settings. However, a recent study found poor validity in detecting postnatal common mental disorders (CMD) in rural Ethiopia. Using similar methodology, the study was replicated in the capital, Addis Ababa.
METHODS: Semantic, content and criterion validity of EPDS, Kessler Scale-6 (K6) and Kessler Scale-10 (K10) were assessed in postnatal women attending vaccination clinics. Criterion validation was undertaken on 100 postnatal women, with local psychiatrist diagnosis of CMD using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) as the criterion measure.
RESULTS: The areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve for the EPDS, K6 and K10 were 0.85 (95\%CI 0.77-0.92), 0.86 (95\%CI 0.76-0.97) and 0.87 (95\%CI 0.78-0.97), respectively. The EPDS generated sensitivity, specificity and misclassification rates of 78.9\%, 75.3\% and 24.0\%, respectively at an optimal cut-off point of 6/7. The corresponding values for the K6 were 84.2\%, 82.7\% and 17.0\% at a cut-off point of 4/5, and for K10 were 84.2\%, 77.8\% and 21.0\% at a cut-off point of 6/7, respectively. The internal reliability Cronbach's alpha for the EPDS, K6 and K10 were 0.71, 0.86 and 0.90, respectively.
LIMITATIONS: Not all postnatal women bring their infants to vaccination clinics which may limit generalisability.
CONCLUSION: The EPDS, K6 and K10 all demonstrated acceptable clinical utility as screening scales for postnatal CMD in an urban setting in Ethiopia. The marked urban-rural difference in EPDS performance within Ethiopia highlights the difficulty of applying urban-validated instruments to rural settings in LAMIC.},

@article{Uwakwe:2003,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of depression in a group of postpartum Nigerian women and to validate the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in this group.
METHOD: Between April and August 2000, all postpartum women who remained in the maternity ward for up to 7 days, and those who attended the postnatal clinics of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital were recruited. Translated local language versions of the EPDS and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale were used to screen the subjects. A structured interview schedule was adapted from the depression section of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and affective module of the ICD-10 Symptom Check List to assess screened subjects.
RESULTS: The total rejection rate was 23\%, with 225 women participating in the study. Twenty-four subjects (10.7\%) had depression. At the optimal cut-off score of 9, the EPDS had a sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 0.97.
CONCLUSION: The EPDS clearly distinguished between depressed and non-depressed postpartum mothers (t = 7.63, P \ensuremath{<} 0.001, df = 222). Because of its brevity and acceptability, it is recommended that the EPDS be used in routine postnatal screening.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There have been few attempts formally to validate screening measures for postnatal common mental disorder in low income country settings. We have investigated the comparative validity of three different screening approaches in a community-based study in Kintampo, Ghana.
METHOD: 160 women aged 15-45 years, and 5-11 weeks postpartum were first screened using the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), with oversampling of higher scorers. The other test assessments were the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Criterion validity was measured against the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS), and concurrent validity against the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. A sub-sample (n=40) was re-interviewed 2 weeks later for test-retest reliability.
RESULTS: Internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) was equivalent across all three test scales; EPDS (0.79), SRQ-20 (0.78) and PHQ-9 (0.79). Test-retest reliability was better for PHQ-9 (ICC 0.75) than for the EPDS (0.51). For criterion validity the PHQ-9 (AUROC 0.90 (0.81-0.98)), was superior to the SRQ-20 (0.74 (0.62-0.86)) and the EPDS ((0.84 (0.76-0.92). Youden's Index was also superior for PHQ-9. Item analysis revealed that a mixture of somatic and cognitive symptoms best discriminated between cases and non-cases for all three scales.
LIMITATIONS: Inability to ascertain inter-rater reliability, order effects and possible loss of technical equivalence due to item modifications.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for the validity, reliability, and superiority of the PHQ-9 over other screening assessments has been extended. The PHQ-9 is short, easy to administer and acceptable to a largely illiterate population of Ghanaian women, 5 to 11 weeks post partum.},

@article{Oates:2003,
	Abstract = {The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths 1997 to 1999 finds that psychiatric disorder, and suicide in particular, is the leading cause of maternal death. Suicide accounted for 28\% of maternal deaths. Women also died from other complications of psychiatric disorder and a significant minority from substance misuse. Some of the findings of the Confidential Enquiry confirm long established knowledge about postpartum psychiatric disorder. The findings highlight the severity and early onset of serious postpartum mental illness and of the risk of recurrence following childbirth faced by women with a previous history of serious mental illness either following childbirth or at other times. These findings led to the recommendation that all women should be asked early in their pregnancy about a previous history of serious psychiatric disorder and that management plans should be in place with regard to the high risk of recurrence following delivery. Other findings of the Enquiry were new and challenged some of the accepted wisdoms of obstetrics and psychiatry. It is likely that the suicide rate following delivery is not significantly different to other times in women's lives and for the first 42 days following delivery may be elevated. This calls into question the so-called `protective effect of maternity'. The overwhelming majority of the suicides died violently, contrasting with the usual finding that women are more likely to die from an overdose of medication. Compared to other causes of maternal death, the suicides were older and socially advantaged. The Enquiry findings suggest that the risk profile for women at risk of suicide following delivery may be different to that in women at other times and in men. None of the women who died had been admitted at any time to a Mother and Baby Unit and their psychiatric care had been undertaken by General Adult Services. None of the women who died had had a previous episode correctly identified and none had had adequate plans for their proactive care. The conclusion is that there is a need for both Psychiatry and Obstetrics to acknowledge the substantial risk that women with a previous psychiatric history of serious mental illness face following delivery.},

	Abstract = {Confidence intervals are widely accepted as a preferred way to present study results. They encompass significance tests and provide an estimate of the magnitude of the effect. However, comparisons of correlations still rely heavily on significance testing. The persistence of this practice is caused primarily by the lack of simple yet accurate procedures that can maintain coverage at the nominal level in a nonlopsided manner. The purpose of this article is to present a general approach to constructing approximate confidence intervals for differences between (a) 2 independent correlations, (b) 2 overlapping correlations, (c) 2 nonoverlapping correlations, and (d) 2 independent R2s. The distinctive feature of this approach is its acknowledgment of the asymmetry of sampling distributions for single correlations. This approach requires only the availability of confidence limits for the separate correlations and, for correlated correlations, a method for taking into account the dependency between correlations. These closed-form procedures are shown by simulation studies to provide very satisfactory results in small to moderate sample sizes. The proposed approach is illustrated with worked examples.},

	Abstract = {To enhance current diagnostic methods used when assessing a depressed individual, an objective screening mechanism, ideally based on non-intrusive behavioral signals, is needed. Given the clinical description of depression speech as `dull, monotonous and flat' and promising previous results from spectral features, we hypothesize that the effects of depression on speech are embedded in spectro-temporal events. To test this hypothesis we explore different methodologies, based on the modulation spectrum, for extracting long-term spectro-temporal information from speech and assess their suitability as a clinical marker of depression. Results indicate that: depressive speech information is captured in the modulation spectrum, long-term spectro-temporal information is important in depressed speech identification and there are potential differences in the effects that depression and psychomotor retardation have on speech production mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Exposing healthy adults to extended periods of wakefulness is known to induce changes in psychomotor functioning [Maruff et al. (2005). J. Sleep Res. 14, 21--27]. The effect of fatigue on speech is less well understood. To date, no studies have examined the pitch and timing of neurologically healthy individuals over 24 h of sustained wakefulness. Therefore, speech samples were systematically acquired (e.g., every 4 h) from 18 healthy adults over 24 h. Stimuli included automated and extemporaneous speech tasks, sustained vowel, and a read passage. Measures of timing, frequency and spectral energy were derived acoustically using {PRAAT} and significant changes were observed on all tasks. The effect of fatigue on speech was found to be strongest just before dawn (after 22 h). Specifically, total speech time, mean pause length, and total signal time all increased as a function of increasing levels of fatigue on the reading tasks; percentage pause and mean pause length decreased on the counting task; F4 variation decreased on the sustained vowel tasks /a:/; and alpha ratio increased on the extemporaneous speech tasks. These findings suggest that acoustic methodologies provide objective data on central nervous system functioning and that changes in speech production occur in healthy adults after just 24 h of sustained wakefulness.},

	Abstract = {Objective  To determine if a post-partum depression syndrome exists among mothers in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, by adapting and validating standard screening instruments. Methods  Using qualitative interviewing techniques, we interviewed a convenience sample of 80 women living in a large peri-urban community to better understand local conceptions of mental illness. We used this information to adapt two standard depression screeners, the Edinburgh Post-partum Depression Scale and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. In a subsequent quantitative study, we identified another 133 women with and without the local depression syndrome and used this information to validate the adapted screening instruments. Results  Based on the qualitative data, we found a local syndrome that closely approximates the Western model of major depressive disorder. The women we interviewed, representative of the local populace, considered this an important syndrome among new mothers because it negatively affects women and their young children. Women (n = 41) identified as suffering from this syndrome had statistically significantly higher depression severity scores on both adapted screeners than women identified as not having this syndrome (n = 20; P {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions  When it is unclear or unknown if Western models of psychopathology are appropriate for use in the local context, these models must be validated to ensure cross-cultural applicability. Using a mixed-methods approach we found a local syndrome similar to depression and validated instruments to screen for this disorder. As the importance of compromised mental health in developing world populations becomes recognized, the methods described in this report will be useful more widely.},

The mean {BDI}-{II} total score was approximately 2 points higher than it was for the {BDI}-{IA}, and the outpatients also endorsed approximately one more symptom on the {BDI}-{II} than they did on the {BDI}-{IA}.

@article{betancourt_psychosocial_2009,
	Abstract = {Multiple studies have found that children from a variety of cultures who have been affected by war are at increased risk for a range of psychosocial problems. However, most studies are based on Western concepts and assume that these are locally applicable. Very few have investigated how psychosocial problems are perceived by the affected communities, families and the young people themselves. Understanding local perceptions is important to ensuring that local priorities are addressed, and addressed in ways that are likely to be acceptable and effective. In this study we used a previously developed rapid ethnographic assessment method to explore local perceptions of psychosocial problems among issues among children and adults from the Acholi ethnic group that have been displaced by the war in northern Uganda. We conducted 45 free list interviews (N= 30 10-17 year olds, N=15 adults) and 57 key informant interviews (N=32 10-17 year olds, N=25 adults) Our purpose was twofold: 1) To test whether this rapid ethnographic assessment approach previously used among adults would be suitable for use with children; and 2) To use this approach to understand the psychosocial problems affecting local children from their own viewpoint and that of their caretakers, in order to inform subsequent assessment and intervention efforts by organizations serving this population. The rapid assessment approach appears to have worked well for interviewing caretakers and children aged 10-17 years. Several locally defined syndromes were described: two tam/par/kumu (depression and dysthymia-like syndromes), ma lwor (an anxiety-like syndrome), and a category of conduct problems referred to as kwo maraco/gin lugero. The descriptions of these local syndromes are similar to Western mood, anxiety and conduct disorders, but contain some culture-specific elements.},

	Abstract = {The availability of brief screening instruments encourages their routine use in identifying individuals who are presumed to be at risk for clinical depression. In primary medical care where this idea has been most tested, however, there is little evidence that screening by itself improves the outcome of depression. Reasons why screening cannot serve as an efficient basis for the prevention of depression are reviewed. Moreover, a positive score on a screening instrument does not indicate a clear need for intervention or the form that any intervention should take. Routine screening should be undertaken only when the resources are available for interpreting the significance of positive screen scores, appropriate and acceptable interventions are available, and potential negative effects of screening can be avoided. Until these conditions can be met, alternatives to screening should be considered.},

	Abstract = {Postpartum depression ({PPD}) is an important mental health issue affecting approximately 10 \% of women. Self-report screening measures represent utility for detecting {PPD} in both clinical and research settings. The current study sought to inspect the accuracy of two screening measures compared to clinical interviews. As part of an ongoing clinical trial, 1,392 women between the ages of 18 and 45 were screened for {PPD} using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ({PHQ}-9) and a six-item scale developed from {CDC} Pregnancy Risk Assessment questions ({PRAMS}-6). Three item subscales of the {PRAMS}-6 were also inspected--three depression ({PRAMS}-3D) and three anxiety items ({PRAMS}-3A). Receiver operating characteristics compared the diagnostic accuracy of the {PHQ}-9, {PRAMS}-6, {PRAMS}-3D, and {PRAMS}-3A to both the Structured Clinical Interview for the {DSM}-{IV} ({SCID}) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The {PHQ}-9, {PRAMS}-6, and {PRAMS}-3D all showed moderate accuracy at diagnosing {PPD}. Diagnostic cut points are provided. The {PRAMS}-6 instrument is a brief and effective screening tool for {PPD}. The time frame of symptom assessment may account for some variability in accuracy between the {PHQ}-9 and {PRAMS} screening instruments.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

	Abstract = {This report describes the historical evolution, development, rationale and validation of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist ({HSCL}), a self-report symptom inventory. The {HSCL} is comprised of 58 items which are representative of the symptom configurations commonly observed among outpatients. It is scored on five underlying symptom dimensions---sommatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety and depression---which have been identified in repeated factor analyses. A series of studies have established the factorial invariance of the primary symptom dimensions, and substantial evidence is given in support of their construct validity. Normative data in terms of both discrete symptoms and primary symptom dimensions are presented on 2,500 subjects---1,800 psychiatric outpatients and 700 normals. Indices of pathology reflect both intensity of distress and prevalence of symptoms in the normative samples. Standard indices of scale reliability are presented, and a broad range of criterion-related validity studies, in particular an important series reflecting sensitivity to treatment with psychotherapeutic drugs, are reviewed and discussed.},

Significant differences between the mean {BDI} and {BDI}-{II} scores necessitated the development of new cutoffs for analogue research on the {BDI}--{II}. Results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a 2-factor solution optimally summarized the data for both versions of the inventory and accounted for a cumulative 41\% and 46\% of the common variance in {BDI} and {BDI}--{II} responses, respectively. These factor solutions were reliably cross-validated, although the importance of each factor varied by gender. The authors conclude that the {BDI}--{II} is a stronger instrument than the {BDI} in terms of its factor structure. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2013 {APA}, all rights reserved).

	Abstract = {{ContextPostnatal} maternal depression ({PND}) is a significant risk factor for infant mental health. Although often targeted alongside other factors in perinatal home-visiting programs with vulnerable families, little impact on {PND} has been observed.{ObjectiveThis} study evaluates the impact on {PND} symptomatology of a multifocal perinatal home-visiting intervention using psychologists in a sample of women presenting risk factors associated with infant mental health difficulties.Methods440 primiparous women were recruited at their seventh month of pregnancy. All were future first-time mothers, under 26, with at least one of three additional psychosocial risk factors: low educational level, low income, or planning to raise the child without the father. The intervention consisted of intensive multifocal home visits through to the child's second birthday. The control group received care as usual. {PND} symptomatology was assessed at baseline and three months after birth using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ({EPDS}).{ResultsAt} three months postpartum, mean ({SD}) {EPDS} scores were 9.4 (5.4) for the control group and 8.6 (5.4) for the intervention group (p = 0.18). The difference between the mean {EPDS} scores was 0.85 (95\% {CI}: 0.35; 1.34). The intervention group had significantly lower {EPDS} scores than controls in certain subgroups: women with few depressive symptoms at inclusion ({EPDS} {\textless}8): difference = 1.66 (95\%{CI}: 0.17; 3.15), p = 0.05, adjusted for baseline {EPDS} score), women who were planning to raise the child with the child's father: difference = 1.45 (95\%{CI}: 0.27; 2.62), p = 0.04 (adjusted); women with a higher educational level: difference = 1.59 (95\%{CI}: 0.50; 2.68) p = 0.05 (adjusted).{ConclusionCAPEDP} failed to demonstrate an overall impact on {PND}. However, post-hoc analysis reveals the intervention was effective in terms of primary prevention and in subgroups of women without certain risk factors. Effective overall reduction of {PND} symptomatology for young, first-time mothers presenting additional psychosocial risk factors may require more tailored interventions.Trial registration {ClinicalTrials}.gov {NCT}00392847Promoting Parental Skills and Enhancing Attachment in Early Childhood ({CAPEDP})},

	Abstract = {Research has shown that the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ({EPDS}) is a valid screening tool and that health visitor interventions based on non - directive counselling are effective treatments for postnatal depression. Purchasers and managers are therefore requiring health visitors to use the {EPDS}. The result should be good evidence - based practice. Research on the {EPDS} and associated health visitor interventions has actually been interpreted very differently in different areas. Worrying misunderstandings have arisen. Implicit and explicit assumptions in some current systems have been examined in the light of available evidence. Where no research has been reported evaluation has been based on experience in health visitor training and clinical practice. It is concluded that the development of good evidence based practice requires critical appraisal of research. New ways of working require a carefully planned collaborative approach between appropriate health care professionals and service users. Training and ongoing support are crucial when new practices are introduced.},

The interaction disturbances of depressed mothers and their infants appear to be universal, across different cultures and socioeconomic status groups and, include less sensitivity of the mothers and responsivity of the infants. Several caregiving activities also appear to be compromised by postpartum depression including feeding practices, most especially breastfeeding, sleep routines and well-child visits, vaccinations and safety practices. These data highlight the need for universal screening of maternal and paternal depression during the postpartum period. Early interventions reviewed here include psychotherapy and interaction coaching for the mothers, and infant massage for their infants.},

	Abstract = {The prevalence of postpartum depression is approximately 13\%. Postpartum depression is associated with a higher maternal morbidity and mortality, and also with pervasive effects on the emotional, cognitive and behavioral development of the child. The aim of our study was to identify socio-demographic, psychosocial and obstetrical risk factors of postpartum depression in a middle class community sample, using a prospective design. We enrolled consecutively 312 pregnant outpatients in a single maternity unit. The first assessment was conducted between 32 and 41 weeks gestation, and a second time between 6 and 8 weeks after delivery. Depressive symptoms were measured using the French version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ({EPDS}). A cut-off score of 12/30 or above was considered as indicative of Major Depression. Of the initial sample of 312 women, 264 (84.6\%) were followed-up between 6 and 8 weeks after delivery and considered for analysis. Depression during pregnancy, migrant status, and physical abuse by the partner were independently associated with postpartum depression when considered together, whereas physical complications were significantly associated with postpartum depression only when adjusting for antenatal depression. Depression during pregnancy, history of physical abuse, migrant status and postpartum physical complications are four major risk factors for postpartum depression.},

	Abstract = {{SUMMARY} Depression in women during their childbearing years is common. Routine depression screening coupled with multidisciplinary collaborative care models integrating case management is paramount. Risk factors for perinatal depression include previous history of depression, interpersonal conflict and limited social support. Antenatal depression may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, such as pre-eclampsia, insufficient weight gain, decreased compliance with prenatal care and premature labor, and continue into postpartum depression, which in turn pose a risk for mother-infant bonding and subsequent child socioemotional development. Currently available literature suggests that overall, the risks of antidepressant use in pregnancy/lactation are small relative to the risks due to maternal untreated illness itself; however, for decision-making, careful individualized risk-benefit analysis and informed consent from the affected patient are crucial. Current guidelines suggest nonpharmacological treatments as first-line interventions for mild-to-moderate perinatal illness, while reserving pharmacological treatment for moderate-to-severe illness. Antidepressants, psychotherapies, alternative or complimentary approaches, and involving family in the supportive care of perinatal women are all effective strategies. More research is needed to determine the long-term and developmental effects in children exposed to antidepressants or untreated illness during pregnancy and lactation.},

@article{oates_perinatal_2003,
	Abstract = {The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths 1997 to 1999 finds that psychiatric disorder, and suicide in particular, is the leading cause of maternal death. Suicide accounted for 28\% of maternal deaths. Women also died from other complications of psychiatric disorder and a significant minority from substance misuse. Some of the findings of the Confidential Enquiry confirm long established knowledge about postpartum psychiatric disorder. The findings highlight the severity and early onset of serious postpartum mental illness and of the risk of recurrence following childbirth faced by women with a previous history of serious mental illness either following childbirth or at other times. These findings led to the recommendation that all women should be asked early in their pregnancy about a previous history of serious psychiatric disorder and that management plans should be in place with regard to the high risk of recurrence following delivery. Other findings of the Enquiry were new and challenged some of the accepted wisdoms of obstetrics and psychiatry. It is likely that the suicide rate following delivery is not significantly different to other times in women's lives and for the first 42 days following delivery may be elevated. This calls into question the so-called 'protective effect of maternity'. The overwhelming majority of the suicides died violently, contrasting with the usual finding that women are more likely to die from an overdose of medication. Compared to other causes of maternal death, the suicides were older and socially advantaged. The Enquiry findings suggest that the risk profile for women at risk of suicide following delivery may be different to that in women at other times and in men. None of the women who died had been admitted at any time to a Mother and Baby Unit and their psychiatric care had been undertaken by General Adult Services. None of the women who died had had a previous episode correctly identified and none had had adequate plans for their proactive care. The conclusion is that there is a need for both Psychiatry and Obstetrics to acknowledge the substantial risk that women with a previous psychiatric history of serious mental illness face following delivery.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Depressive and anxiety disorders in the postpartum period cause significant suffering for women. State public health officials across the country use the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC})-sponsored Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System ({PRAMS}) to assess health behaviors and conditions, including depression and anxiety, that occur around the time of pregnancy. The purpose of the present study was to validate two to three items that could be included on the {PRAMS} questionnaire to detect depression and anxiety among postpartum women in a surveillance system.
{METHODS}: A comprehensive set of 16 depression and anxiety items was developed and tested in a final sample of 1077 postpartum women, 353 of whom completed Structured Clinical Interview for {DSM}-{IV} ({SCID}) interviews to determine the presence of a major depressive episode ({MDE}) and generalized anxiety disorder ({GAD}). Regression analyses reduced candidate items to 5 each for {MDE} and {GAD}. Responses were scored on a 5-point scale ranging from never (1) to always (5), and 2 and 3 item combinations of these items were examined for their psychometric properties as indicators of {MDE} and {GAD}.
{RESULTS}: Item sets varied in their psychometric properties. The combination of depressed mood, felt hopeless, and slowed down {\textgreater}  9 (out of a possible total of 15) yielded the highest positive predictive value ({PPV}=60) and estimated {MDE} prevalence most accurately (24.4\% vs. 25.4\% true prevalence). The combination of felt panicky, felt restless, and problems sleeping {\textgreater}9 estimated {GAD} prevalence most accurately (20.2\% vs. 15.7\% true prevalence) and had high specificity (83\%).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Depression and anxiety can be detected using very few items, which makes assessment feasible in surveillance systems, such as {PRAMS}, and in primary care settings that have severe limits on time for depression and anxiety screening.},

@article{ovuga_response_2005,
	Abstract = {Background
A 36-item version of the Response Inventory for Stressful Life Events ({RISLE}) was derived from the longer 100-item version. The 36-item version may be more appropriate for use in larger population sample.

Objective
To compare the responses of the 36-item {RISLE} to interview derived psychiatric diagnoses and suicidal ideation in a sub-sample of the general population and student samples reported in the accompanying paper.

Methods
Clinical interviews using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ({MINI}) were carried out on 67 members of the general population and 58 members of the student samples. Receiver Operating Characteristic ({ROC}) curves were constructed for the {RISLE} responses using current depressive disorder, any current psychiatric disorder, and past month suicidality variables. Sensitivities, specificities, predictive values and likelihood ratios were determined based on various cut-off points based on {ROC} curves. Kappa statistic was determined to evaluate the level of agreement between the result of questionnaire surveys and research clinical interviews at different cut-off points on the {RISLE}.

Results
The probability of correct detection of current depression was 79\%, any current psychiatric disorder 83\% and past month suicidality 83\%. The optimal cut-offs for the general population was 10 and for the students 6. High scores on the 36-item {RISLE} were associated with a past history of suicide attempt and recent and past suicide ideation.

Conclusion
The 36-item {RISLE} appears to have good concurrent validity and may be a reasonable screening instrument for psychological distress in the Ugandan population. The results suggest that the {RISLE} alone is capable of screening for both depressive mood and suicidal ideation effectively at different cut-off points. Thus the {RISLE} is capable of achieving what normally takes two scales such as the {BDI} and {BSS} to do separately. However, further validation work is required using larger population samples in clinical interviews in prospective studies.},

	Abstract = {Background
No indigenous screening instruments are available for the detection of depression and suicide risk relevant to the context of patients in Uganda. The Response Inventory for Stressful Life Events ({RISLE}) may be an appropriate tool, but requires validation.

Objective
The paper reports on the development of the {RISLE} and the refinement of the 100-item {RISLE} into a shorter version for use in large samples.

Methods
Two samples were used in the validation exercise: a general population sample from Adjumani and Bugiri districts and a student sample from Makerere University in Kampala district. The {RISLE} responses were subjected to Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis. The 100-item {RISLE} and resulting shorter version were compared and their concurrent validity assessed by comparing test results to the individuals' responses to the Beck Depression Inventory ({BDI}) and the Beck Scale for Suicide ideation ({BSS}).

Results
Nine hundred thirty nine questionnaires were available for the population sample, 101 for the student sample. The 100-item {RISLE} was reduced to 36-items without loss of face validity. Both the 100- and 36-item versions had high internal consistency, were highly correlated with each other and with the {BDI} and {BSS}.

Conclusion
The 36-item {RISLE} appears to be an advance on the 100-item version, retaining its internal consistency and concurrent validity.},

@article{pitt_atypical_1968,
	Abstract = {It is well known that women are often depressed after child-birth, but only those ill enough to be admitted to hospital have received much study.
A random sample of 305 maternity hospital patients was given a questionnaire designed to measure anxiety and depression associated with childbirth in the seventh month of pregnancy and again 6-8 weeks after delivery. Potential depressives, whose scores had increased, and potential controls, free from depression, with unchanged or diminished scores, were thus obtained, and the diagnosis was confirmed or excluded by clinical interview. Depressives were followed up by questionnaire one year later.
Thirty-three (10-8 per cent.) subjects developed puerperal depression. In only one of these was the illness classical; in the rest it was atypical. Twelve depressives (3.9 per cent. of the total population studied) had not improved after one year. There were also 19 subjects (6.2 per cent.) with new or exacerbated psychological symptoms who were classified as doubtfully depressed.
Depressives differed most from controls in their M.P.I. scores. Their neuroticism scores were highly significantly greater, and their extraversion scores significantly less. It is unsure whether these scores represented their previous personalities, or simply the fact that they were depressed. At probably significant levels, more depressives had a history of recent dysmenorrohea, more had been married for less than three years, fewer had obstetric complications in pregnancy, and more suffered "Maternity Blues" in the early puerperium. There were no significant differences in respect of previous psychiatric, physical or obstetric disorder, age, endocrine abnormality, complicated labour or obvious psychological or social factors.
Atypical depression is, therefore, a common and important complication of the puerperium, about which more needs to be known.},

	Abstract = {The {CES}-D scale is a short self-report scale designed to measure depressive symptomatology in the general population. The items of the scale are symptoms associated with depression which have been used in previously validated longer scales. The new scale was tested in household interview surveys and in psychiatric settings. It was found to have very high internal consistency and adequate test- retest repeatability. Validity was established by pat terns of correlations with other self-report measures, by correlations with clinical ratings of depression, and by relationships with other variables which support its construct validity. Reliability, validity, and factor structure were similar across a wide variety of demographic characteristics in the general population samples tested. The scale should be a useful tool for epidemiologic studies of de pression.},

Uncontrolled and controlled effect sizes were assessed in separate meta-analyses. There was significant improvement in depressive symptoms from pretreatment to posttreatment, with an uncontrolled overall effect size (Hedges' g) of 1.61 after removal of outliers and correction for publication bias. Symptom levels at posttreatment were below cutoff levels indicative of clinically significant symptoms. At posttreatment, intervention groups demonstrated significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared to control groups, with an overall controlled effect size (Hedges' g) of 0.65 after removal of outliers. Individual psychotherapy was superior to group psychotherapy with regard to changes in symptoms from pretreatment to posttreatment. Interventions including an interpersonal therapy component were found to have greater effect sizes, compared to control conditions, than interventions including a cognitive--behavioral component. Implications of the findings for clinical practice and future research are discussed.},

A systematic review identified 37 randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in which an intervention was compared to a control condition. Differences between treatment and control conditions in the level of depressive symptoms and prevalence of depressive episodes by 6 months postpartum were assessed in separate analyses. Depressive symptoms were significantly lower at post-treatment in intervention conditions, with an overall effect size in the small range after exclusion of outliers (Hedges' g = 0.18). There was a 27\% reduction in the prevalence of depressive episodes in intervention conditions by 6 months postpartum after removal of outliers and correction for publication bias. Later timing of the postpartum assessment was associated with smaller differences between intervention and control conditions in both analyses. Among studies that assessed depressive symptoms using the {EPDS}, higher levels of depressive symptoms at pre-treatment were associated with smaller differences in depressive symptoms by 6 months postpartum. These findings suggest that interventions designed to prevent postpartum depression effectively reduce levels of postpartum depressive symptoms and decrease risk for postpartum depressive episodes.},

	Abstract = {{AbstractObjective}
Clinical practice guidelines disagree on whether health care professionals should screen women for depression during pregnancy or postpartum. The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether depression screening improves depression outcomes among women during pregnancy or the postpartum period.
Methods
Searches included the {CINAHL}, {EMBASE}, {ISI}, {MEDLINE}, and {PsycINFO} databases through April 1, 2013; manual journal searches; reference list reviews; citation tracking of included articles; and trial registry reviews. {RCTs} in any language that compared depression outcomes between women during pregnancy or postpartum randomized to undergo depression screening versus women not screened were eligible.
Results
There were 9,242 unique titles/abstracts and 15 full-text articles reviewed. Only 1 {RCT} of screening postpartum was included, but none during pregnancy. The eligible postpartum study evaluated screening in mothers in Hong Kong with 2-month-old babies (N = 462) and reported a standardized mean difference for symptoms of depression at 6 months postpartum of 0.34 (95\% confidence interval = 0.15 to 0.52, P \&lt; 0.001). Standardized mean difference per 44 additional women treated in the intervention trial arm compared to the non-screening arm was approximately 1.8. Risk of bias was high, however, because the status of outcome measures was changed post-hoc and because the reported effect size per woman treated was 6--7 times the effect sizes reported in comparable depression care interventions.
Conclusion
There is currently no evidence from any well-designed and conducted {RCT} that screening for depression would benefit women in pregnancy or postpartum. Existing guidelines that recommend depression screening during pregnancy or postpartum should be re-considered.},

@article{Tsai:2013,
	Abstract = {{BackgroundA} major barrier to improving perinatal mental health in Africa is the lack of locally validated tools for identifying probable cases of perinatal depression or for measuring changes in depression symptom severity. We systematically reviewed the evidence on the reliability and validity of instruments to assess perinatal depression in African settings.Methods and {FindingsOf} 1,027 records identified through searching 7 electronic databases, we reviewed 126 full-text reports. We included 25 unique studies, which were disseminated in 26 journal articles and 1 doctoral dissertation. These enrolled 12,544 women living in nine different North and sub-Saharan African countries. Only three studies (12\%) used instruments developed specifically for use in a given cultural setting. Most studies provided evidence of criterion-related validity (20 [80\%]) or reliability (15 [60\%]), while fewer studies provided evidence of construct validity, content validity, or internal structure. The Edinburgh postnatal depression scale ({EPDS}), assessed in 16 studies (64\%), was the most frequently used instrument in our sample. Ten studies estimated the internal consistency of the {EPDS} (median estimated coefficient alpha, 0.84; interquartile range, 0.71-0.87). For the 14 studies that estimated sensitivity and specificity for the {EPDS}, we constructed 2 x 2 tables for each cut-off score. Using a bivariate random-effects model, we estimated a pooled sensitivity of 0.94 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.68-0.99) and a pooled specificity of 0.77 (95\% {CI}, 0.59-0.88) at a cut-off score of ≥9, with higher cut-off scores yielding greater specificity at the cost of lower sensitivity. {ConclusionsThe} {EPDS} can reliably and validly measure perinatal depression symptom severity or screen for probable postnatal depression in African countries, but more validation studies on other instruments are needed. In addition, more qualitative research is needed to adequately characterize local understandings of perinatal depression-like syndromes in different African contexts.},

Methods A Cohort study nested within 4-weekly surveillance of all women of reproductive age to identify pregnancies and collect data on births and deaths in the Kintampo Health Research Centre study area of Ghana. Women were screened for {AND} using the Patient Health Questionnaire ({PHQ}-9) to ascertain {DSM}-{IV} major or minor depression. Outcomes were adverse birth outcomes, maternal/infant morbidity, and uptake of key newborn care practices, examined using logistic regression; effect sizes reported as relative risks with 95\% confidence intervals. Results 20679 (89.6\%) pregnant women completed the {PHQ}-9. The prevalence of {AND} was 9.9\% (n = 2032) (95\% confidence interval 9.4\%--10.2\%). {AND} was associated with: prolonged labour ({RR} 1.25, 95\% {CI} 1.02--1.53); peripartum complications ({RR} 1.11, 95\% {CI} 1.07--1.15);postpartum complications ({RR} 1.27, 96\% {CI} 1.21--1.34); non-vaginal delivery ({RR} 1.19, 95\% {CI} 1.02--1.40); newborn illness ({RR} 1.52, 95\% {CI} 1.16--1.99); and bed net use during pregnancy ({RR} 0.93, 95\% {CI} 0.89--0.98), but not neonatal deaths, still births, low birth weight, immediate breast feeding initiation, or exclusive breastfeeding. {AND} was marginally associated with preterm births ({RR} 1.32, 95\% {CI} 0.98--1.76). Conclusion This paper has contributed important evidence on the role of antenatal depression as a potential contributor to maternal and infant morbidity. Non-pharmacological treatments anchored on primary care delivery structures are recommended as an immediate step. We further recommend that trials are designed to assess if treating antenatal depression in conjunction with improving the quality of obstetric care results in improved maternal and newborn outcomes.},

@article{yawn_repeated_2015,
	Abstract = {{PURPOSE} Postpartum depression ({PPD}) screening at 4 to 12 weeks' postpartum can improve outcomes for women when linked to in-practice management programs. The benefit of repeated {PPD} screening during the first year postpartum remains unclear.
{METHODS} We report a substudy of a large pragmatic trial of early {PPD} screening and practice management, the Translating Research into Practice for Postpartum Depression ({TRIPPD}) study. Outcome analyses were based on demographic information and Patient Health Questionnaire ({PHQ}-9) screening scores from questionnaires mailed to all enrolled women at baseline (4 to 12 weeks' postpartum) and again at 6 and at 12 months' postpartum. The main outcomes of this substudy were the 6- and 12-month rates of {PHQ}-9 scores that were 10 or greater for women whose baseline {PHQ}-9 scores were less than 10. Women whose scores were 10 or greater would be considered at high risk of {PPD} and appropriate for further evaluation.
{RESULTS} At 6 months, 134 (10.9\%) of the 1,235 women who did not have {PHQ}-9 scores greater than 10 at baseline had elevated scores appropriate for further evaluation. At 12 months, 59 (6.1\%) of the 969 women who did not have {PHQ}-9 scores greater than 10 at baseline or at 6 months had elevated scores. Together the 6- and 12-month repeated screenings identified 193 women at high risk of depression. This finding represents 13.5\% of the 1,432 women whose screening results were negative for {PPD} at baseline.
{CONCLUSIONS} Repeated {PPD} screening at 6 and 12 months' postpartum increases the percentage of women identified as being at high risk of {PPD}. Further work will be required to understand the impact of this repeated screening on patient outcomes.},

	Abstract = {{ABSTRACT}-- A self-assessment scale has been developed and found to be a reliable instrument for detecting states of depression and anxiety in the setting of an hospital medical outpatient clinic. The anxiety and depressive subscales are also valid measures of severity of the emotional disorder. It is suggested that the introduction of the scales into general hospital practice would facilitate the large task of detection and management of emotional disorder in patients under investigation and treatment in medical and surgical departments.},

@article{zung_self-rating_1965,
	Abstract = {The fact that there is a need for assessing depression, whether as an affect, a symptom, or a disorder is obvious by the numerous scales and inventories available and in use today.The need to assess depression simply and specifically as a psychiatric disorder has not been met by most scales available today. We became acutely aware of this situation in a research project where we needed to correlate both the presence and severity of a depressive disorder in patients with other parameters such as arousal response during sleep and changes with treatment of the depressive disorder. It was felt that the general depression scales used were insufficient for our purpose and that the more specific scales were also inadequate. These inadequacies related to factors such as the length of a scale or inventory being too long and too time consuming, especially for a patient},
